# README-Generator

Created a quick, professional READ ME generator

## Description

We've developed a command-line tool that serves as a proficient READ ME generator. It offers suggested content titles and questions, streamlining the process of shaping your project's README. This allows you, the project creator, to focus more on actual project development. Simply provide information about your application repository when prompted, and the tool will automatically generate a top-notch README.md with sections such as:

- Project Title
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions
